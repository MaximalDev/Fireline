# Fireline

A lightweight Unity networking manager that leverages Epic Online Services lobbies for matchmaking and FishNet for high-performance transport. Designed for VR and multiplayer games, Fireline delivers:

- **Seamless Lobby Management**  
  Create, join and monitor public or private EOS lobbies with real-time member updates.

- **Unified Player Count**  
  Single source of truth: EOS lobby size drives all in-game player counts, eliminating host/client mismatches.

- **Fish-Net Transport**  
  Built on Fish-Net’s scalable server/client architecture, supporting any number of players—from 1 to 100+.

- **Dissonance Voice Chat**  
  Plug-and-play support for Dissonance free-forever voice-over-IP, tying voice channels directly to your EOS lobby.

- **Free, Forever**  
  No licensing fees. Fireline is MIT-style open source—use it in personal or commercial projects without cost.

- **Scalable & Future-Ready**  
  Handles dynamic group sizes, backend events, and rapid connect/disconnect scenarios with minimal overhead.
